1462931854437195778	I'm still on the fence about calling the COVID-19 vaccine as a vaccine because unlike all the other existing vaccines, you can still get COVID-19 albeit with better prognosis. But, still you get COVID-19. It is highly unusual.

1462932222818856965	@TonyHinton2016 ... and that in itself is a clue.  why? cus the level of protection drops over time... the same way as it does once you've had COVID and built your own antibodies... if you're lucky enough.  they do NOT last forever... and people like YOU are NOT sharing THAT side of the story.	
1462932265701416964	@hpchlo @BBCNews Absolutely it can - and, as you'd know if you'd done any research at all, Covid is substantially more infectious and more deadly.  So would you go out shopping on a busy weekend if you knew you had Covid?

1462932866225086464	@RyanRenee9 Thousands of doctors say covid is fictional. A new name for things we have been dealing with for many years. Coupled with sudden mass exposure of all the normal data we normally never hear about. 200k people die every year from flu. This past year? Less than 2000 people.

I also travel a lot so I test frequently. So that's how I know I've never been positive... Maybe it'd be the case of isolating the fragile people then?
