## COVID vaccine discussions in social media (Twitter)

Topics of study:
1. The salient topics discussed around COVID and what each topic primarily concerns
2. Relative engagement with those topics
3. How positive/negative the response to the pandemic/vaccination has been.

TODO:
- [x] Finish data collection before november 27
- [x] Open coding on 200 tweets, investigate and develop a set of topics
- [x] Manually annotate all 1000 tweets
- [ ] Analysis and report writing

### Collection
Your analysis will draw on Twitter posts (tweets). To inform your analysis, you should collect 1,000 tweets within a 3 day window. You should set filters such that all 1,000 posts mention either COVID, vaccination, or a name-brand COVID vaccine AND all are in English (ensure that the language field is set to “en”… this isn’t exact, but it gets close). You can filter by
hashtags or words when collecting Twitter data. You can choose the exact words, as long as they are related to the context that we mentioned before.

Each post in your collection should be unique – meaning that you shouldn’t include an identical tweet or retweet twice.

### Annotation
To develop your topics, conduct an open coding on 200 tweets (approach the exercise requiring each tweet to belong to exactly one topic). You should aim for between 3-8 topics
in total.

Once your topics have been designed, manually annotate the rest of the 1,000 tweets in your dataset. During this annotation, also code each post for positive/neutral/negative sentiment. While double annotation would usually be used, for this project (given time
constraints), use single annotation. While double annotation would usually be used, for this project (given time constraints), use single annotation.

### Analysis
Characterize your topics by computing the 10 words in each category with the highest tf-idf scores (to compute inverse document frequency, use all 1,000 posts that you originally collected.

### Interpretation
Your report should be written using the AAAI format found here (you may use either Word or Latex). The template formatting (e.g., font, font size, spacing, citation style) should be followed strictly. The report structure should consist of the following sections (the lengths are suggestions):
1. Introduction (0.5 page) – general overview and key findings
2. Data (0.5 page) – describe your dataset. This should include statistics relevant to the project – the number of tweets you originally started with, the keywords used to collect tweets, and any design decisions you had to make around the filtering of this content.
3. Methods (0.5 page) – explanation and justification for what you did. Focus on the design decisions you made NOT listed in this document that impacted your results.
4. Results (1 pages) – share all your findings including the topics selected (and their definitions), topic characterization, and topic engagement.
5. Discussion (1 pages) – interpret your results in terms of what they reveal about the way each candidate was being discussed and perceived. Make extensive use of your results to justify your interpretations.
6. Group Member contributions (0.25 page) – a description of the contributions each group member made to this project.
7. References (< 1 page) – this is an optional section should you reference other works in your report.

The report must be between 5 and 7 pages in length, not including references. Figures are encouraged – but should be used to maximum effect (fluffy or otherwise unnecessary images that do not make strong contributions to the report will lead to point deductions).
